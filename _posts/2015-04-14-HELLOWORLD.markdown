I am finally doing it. I have been toying with the idea of  launching a blog for years, yet I've never garner enough interest to actually do it. Now however things have changed. Theses are exciting times in my life and I want to use this blog to document and share with you all not only what I am learning, but anything I think is worth sharing. Without further ado:

## Techie Friend
   I have always been in love with tech. Ever since I was young, I remember always enjoying computers or any gadget I could get my hands on. I've been a gamer for years, from the Super Nintendo to the Xbox One, and even the PC. I've owned them all. I have owned almost every Flagship phone since the [Samsung Instinct](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_SPH-M800). Does and one remember the Instinct?

   For over a decade I have enjoyed and benefited from the technology of our modern world.  Heck I took great pride on the fact that I was always on the cutting edge, always knowing the inside scoop, and being a first adopter of the newest toys.
   Nonetheless with all that going for me, there was this nagging feeling that I was missing out on something. I was always considered very smart, and celebrated as the "indispensable techie" by those closest to me. Yet within myself I felt that the ones that are truly indispensable  are the programmers with the magic to build the technology that we all benefit from.

   I have always been called a geek,  simply because I know just a small fraction more about tech than those I associate with.
   However I'd never considered myself a geek. As much as I coveted that status deeply, that world seem so far out of reach to me.
   I was persuaded that only "certain kinds of people" had the mental capacity to build software. You either had to be part of that special sort that was born with the "gift", or you had to be a genius that could easily pick up the nessary skills.

## A path to true Geekdom
   For years I existed with this false notion that I could never achieve "true geek" status. That is until one faithful day. [CES 2009](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show#2009) A little company that could, announce the most promising smartphone, and mobile platform since the iPhone and IOS. Palm announce the [Palm Pre](http://www.cnet.com/products/palm-pre-sprint/) powered by their shiny new mobile OS called [webOS](http://www.hpwebos.com/us/).  WebOS was breath taking, it was the most beautiful and intuitive OS that I'd ever seen. They not only stole the show at CES but for the 5 months that passed before its release, the the web was in an uproar in anticipation. WebOS was so forward thinking that it garnered some unlikely praise from the late Steve Jobs.

 > And we're pretty good at making software, we showed that in the iPod...
other people are good at it too, like Palm, but we brought great software
to the smartphone space. --Steve Jobs

   I was sold completely sold on webOS. It was the first mobile platform that got [got multi tasking right](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=13ldiuwSzb8), years later [Blackberry](http://blog.laptopmag.com/hp-says-blackberry-playbook-result-of-fast-imitation-cycle-rim-responds), [Android](http://www.webosnation.com/switching-android-itll-probably-feel-familiar), and [IOS](http://www.engadget.com/2013/06/12/jon-rubinstein-os-x-and-ios-7-borrow-features-from-webos/)  follow suit. WebOS was first to implement [OTA's](http://www.webosnation.com/webos-ota-updates-are-still-coming-device-warranties-will-still-be-honored) (over the air updates), which is now common to all the big platforms. They popularized [interactive notifications](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zplVSI0M93o). Everyone has adopted their [Synergy](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=00uTOm2f7BY) feature. There were much more innovations, but the single biggest thing that sold me on WebOS was when I saw, how easy it was to [make apps for WebOS](https://developer.palm.com/content/resources/develop/building_your_first_app.html). WebOS was build on web technology. All you need to know was simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to make interactive applications for webOS devices. I had found my "in", this was my opportunity to make the transition to geek statues! 
 
## Epilogue? 
  
   It was around December 25, 2010 that I took my first swing at webOS development. I  wish I could tell you that everything went well and I became a rockstar coder. But that's not what went down. No it's not even close. In fact it wasn't until January  of this year that I really became passionate enough about web development to actually start to learn it for real. So how does that work? How is it possible that I looked into programming back in January 2011, I even hacked two apps together for webOS that combine had over 20,000 downloads. Yet some how I just starting learning programming for the first time in January 2015. What Gives?
   
   For those of you wondering what happen between those 5 years, stay tune for part 2 of this blog post. I will go over the dramatic details of my very exciting life (cue the dramatic music). You guys will get to understand why I am so excited and determined, and last but not least see how much I have learned (my progress) since January.
