I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Rocket Mortgage](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/){:target="_blank"}. Before starting at Stealth, I worked Exigo Office as Web Developer Team Lead. [Exigo](http://exigo.com/){:target="_blank"}.

 Aside from using `C# | Asp.net MVC` at work, I also have experience Angular, TypeScript and `Python | Django`. Though I don't particularly enjoy too much frontend tech, I do have experience with 
`JavaScript/Jquery`, `HTML`, `CSS` and `Twitter Bootstrap`.
