Currently I am a web developer at Exigo Office, learning .Net with C#. Before starting at Exigo, I attended an in person 
coding bootcamp called [EpicU](http://www.epicu.org/){:target="_blank"}.

I am also learning web development with an online bootcamp called [LaunchSchool](https://launchschool.com/){:target="_blank"}.
 Aside from using `C# | Asp.net MVC` at work, I'm also interested in `Ruby & Rails` and `Python | Django`. I explorer 
 these tools in my free time. Though I try to avoid too much frontend tech, I do have experience with 
`JavaScript/Jquery`, `HTML`, `CSS` and `Twitter Bootstrap`.
