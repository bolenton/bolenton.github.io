Greetings! My name is Taurus Omejia. I recently fell into web development.
There is so much to learn in this space. It seems there's something new popping up everyday. Its overwhelming!
Nevertheless I am loving this journey. I have learned so much in such a short peroid of time, and I am committed
to sticking with it.

Currently I am learning .Net with C# as student of an in person coding bootcamp called [EpicU](https://www.epicu.org/),
I am also learning web developement with an online bootcamp called [TeaLeaf Academy](https://www.gotealeaf.com/).
I am mainly interested in the backend via `Ruby & Rails`, `Python | Django`, and `C# | Asp.net MVC`, with a little
`JavaScript/Jquery.` for good measure. Though I am not much into frontend, I have basic knowledge of `HTML`, and `CSS`.


<div class="profile {% if page.featured == true %} featured {% endif %}">
    {% if site.author_image != "" %}<img src="{{ site.author_image }}" class="profileimage" alt="user">{% endif %}
    <h4>{{ site.author_name }}</h4>
    
    <p>{{ site.author_bio }}</p>
    <hr>
</div>
