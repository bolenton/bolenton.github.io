I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Rocket Companies](https://www.rocketcompanies.com/){:target="_blank"}. Before starting at Rocket Companies, I worked with [Stealth Monitoring](https://www.stealthmonitoring.com/){:target="_blank"} in Addison Texas, where I led the team in building out their microservice architecture we scaled their software footprint in the security monitoring space. I've also worked with Exigo In as a Web Team Lead. [Exigo](http://exigo.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I have broad experience using many different software stacks including `.net | C# | Asp.net MVC`, `JavaScript, Angular, TypeScript`, `Python | Django`. I have extensive experience with providing Cloud Solutions, working with Microservices and Containerization.
