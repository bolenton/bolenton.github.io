I've also worked with Exigo In as a Web Team Lead. [Exigo](http://exigo.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I have broad experience using many different software stacks including  Aside from using `C# | Asp.net MVC` at work, I also have experience Angular, TypeScript and `Python | Django`. Though I don't particularly enjoy too much frontend tech, I do have experience with 
`JavaScript/Jquery`, `HTML`, `CSS` and `Twitter Bootstrap`.
