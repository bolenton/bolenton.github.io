Greetings! My name is Taurus Omejia. I recently fell into web development.
There is so much to learn in this space. It seems there's something new popping up everyday. Its overwhelming!
Nevertheless I am loving this journey. I have learned so much in such a short peroid of time, and I am committed
to sticking with it.

Currently I am a web developer at Exigo Office, learning .Net with C#. Before starting at Exigo, I attended an in person 
coding bootcamp called [EpicU](https://www.epicu.org/).

I am also learning web development with an online bootcamp called [TeaLeaf Academy](https://www.gotealeaf.com/).
Aside from using `C# | Asp.net MVC` at work, I'm also interested in `Ruby & Rails`, `Python | Django`, I am trying to
explorer those tools in my free time. Though I try to avoid too much frontend tech, I do have experience with 
`JavaScript/Jquery.`, `HTML`, `CSS` and `Twitter Bootstrap`.
