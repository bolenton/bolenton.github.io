Hello! My name is Taurus Omejia. I recently fell into web development.
There is so much to learn in this space. It seems there's something new popping up everyday. Its overwhelming!
Nevertheless I am loving this journey. I have learned so much, and I am committed to stick with it.

Currently I am a student of [TeaLeaf Academy](https://www.gotealeaf.com/). I am focusing on
learning all about `Ruby & Rails` and the backend. I also dabble in `Python.`
After I get a handle on `Rails,` I want to jump head first into `Django.`
I also tolerate `JavaScript/Jquery.` Wanna know more?
